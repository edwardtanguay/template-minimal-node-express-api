# template-minimal-node-express-api

This is a minimum Node/Express API that has two purposes:

## features

- Node/Express
- TypeScript
  - executed with tsx
  - compiled with tsc
  - watched with nodemon
- ES6 modules

## setup and start
  - `npm run build` 
  - `npm start`

## hosting

- the package json has two scripts ready for hosting: `build` and `start`
- if you want to host this backend at a hosting service such as **Render** or **Cyclic**, or a cloud machine at e.g. **Hetzner** or **DigitalOcean**, use these scripts:
  - build command: `npm i && npm run build`
  - start command: `npm start`
